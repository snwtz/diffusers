MULTISPECTRAL VAE TRAINING PIPELINE - DIGITAL ARCHIVE
====================================================

This digital archive contains the complete implementation of a multispectral VAE (MSAE) training pipeline
for adapting Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) to generate synthetic 5-channel multispectral plant imagery.
The pipeline enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained SD3 VAE for hyperspectral data
while maintaining spectral fidelity and SD3 compatibility.

RESEARCH CONTEXT
---------------
This work addresses the challenge of adapting pretrained diffusion models for multispectral
plant imaging applications. The core innovation is a lightweight adapter architecture that
bridges 5-channel hyperspectral data to the 3-channel RGB format expected by SD3, enabling
synthetic multispectral image generation through DreamBooth fine-tuning.
